# alexburgos.dev

My personal website built with SvelteKit and Vite, deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- Vite
- Daisy UI
- Cloudflare Pages
- GitHub Actions

## Development

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as its preferred package manager. While npm and yarn are also supported, you'll need:

- Node.js 18+ (for ESM support)
- TypeScript support in your environment

```bash
# Using Bun (recommended)
bun install
bun run dev

# Using npm
npm install
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to Cloudflare Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
